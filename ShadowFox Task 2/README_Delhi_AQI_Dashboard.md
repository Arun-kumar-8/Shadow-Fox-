# 🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis – Delhi  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of **ShadowFox Internship – Level 2**, where I conducted an in-depth analysis of the **Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi**.  
The aim was to address the city’s environmental challenges by analyzing **key pollutants, seasonal variations, and geographical factors**, and to provide **data-driven insights** for air quality improvement and public health strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze **key pollutants**: PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO  
- Identify **seasonal variations** in air quality trends  
- Assess the **impact of geographical factors** (traffic, industrial zones, wind patterns)  
- Apply **statistical analyses** to quantify relationships  
- Build **visualizations** for better interpretation of AQI dynamics

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Analysis & Visualizations  
- ✅ **Trend Analysis** – daily, monthly, and seasonal AQI patterns  
- ✅ **Pollutant Contribution** – pollutant-wise heatmaps & correlations  
- ✅ **Seasonal Boxplots** – identifying pollution peaks across winter, summer, monsoon  
- ✅ **Station-wise Comparisons** – geographical AQI variations  
- ✅ **Statistical Tests** – ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis for seasonal differences, regression for pollutant influence  
- ✅ **Visual Insights** – line charts, scatter plots, bar graphs, wind-rose diagrams

## 🔑 Key Insights  
- **PM2.5 and PM10** are the dominant drivers of poor AQI in Delhi  
- Strong **seasonal variation** – pollution spikes in winter, dips during monsoon  
- **Geographical hotspots** near traffic corridors and industrial areas show persistently high AQI  
- Data-driven interventions can help design **targeted policies** for pollution control and **public health awareness**
